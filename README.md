# Project 2 - Wordle Pt. 2

Submitted by: Antwon Walls

Wordle Pt. 2 is an app that extends from the previous Wordle app, with a sleeker look. The user now has options to change settings and a stretch feature. In the setting, the user can change the number of letters in the word goal, change the word theme, and make the theme harder by turning on Alien Wordle mode. With Alien Wordle, every time you guess the wrong word, the word resets. In the stretch feature, the user now has the ability to reset the game with the current settings.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

## Notes

I had issues with Exercise 4 and Exercise 3. I didn’t know how to properly implement the theme settings and for Exercise 4 I couldn’t get my alienWordle function to work
